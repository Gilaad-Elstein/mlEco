MLEco​ — 
A simulated ecosystem of “living” agents.

Developed on top of a self implemented neural network, an ecosystem of
agents that must eat and breed to survive in a simulated 2D world.

● Neuro Evolution algorithm to facilitate genetic learning
● Witnessed agents exhibiting complex behavior at scouting food,
  breeding and conserving energy
